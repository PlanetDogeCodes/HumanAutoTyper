# HumanAutoTyper

A Human Auto-Typer extension that uses advanced techniques to evade detection and pass as human.

## What this Extension Does

Human Typer types text into a document one character at a time, instead of pasting it instantly.  
It does this in a way that *looks like a person typing*. It can:

- Type with variable speed  
- Type with random pauses and hesitations  
- Type in a way that incurs random typos that it later corrects 
- Automatically type at the selected cursor position  
- Continue to work even when its control panel isn’t focused/you're in another tab

## Why this matters

Many people assume automation is easy to detect because it’s:
- too fast
- too perfect
- too consistent

Human Typer is designed to do the opposite. Instead of typing in a consistent manner, it can:
- slow itself down
- introduce errors
- wait between actions
- behave irregularly
This is all so that it can evade detection by writing plugins such as Brisk for Teachers.

## Features and Tools

### 🧠 Out-of-window typing
Unlike most Human Auto-Typing extensions, this extension runs in a **persistent sidebar** and continues working even when:
- You click back into the document
- You scroll the page
- The UI is not in focus
- You go to another tab
- You open another window


### 🎯 Cursor-based typing
The extension types exactly where the cursor is placed, making sure that the formatting looks realistic and human-constructed.


### ⏱ Adjustable pauses and speed
The extension lets you control:
- Typing speed (WPM)
- How much the speed fluctuates
- How long random pauses can last

### ❌ Mistakes with correction
To seem human, it will randomly:
- Type the wrong letter
- Pause
- Press backspace
- Retype the correct letter

### ⏸ Pause and resume at word boundaries
The extension can:
- Pause at any time
- Resume later without breaking the flow

### 🔌 Auto-attach behavior
When started, the extension will automatically connect to the active tab and begin typing. It will show that "This Tab is Being Debugged", as debug mode is needed to attach onto a tab and type even when you aren't currently on the tab.
